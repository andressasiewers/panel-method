# panel-method

Pressure coefficient (Cp) distribution around a cylinder using the panel method, which is a numerical technique employed to solve potential flow problems, such as the flow around a cylinder, by discretizing the surface of the object into a number of flat panels and solving for the flow parameters on each panel.
